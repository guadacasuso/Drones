##What can I do  with it? 
You can develop Mobile Apps using the DJI MobileSDK that DJI has as part of its development platform (and works also for their other models Phantom 3,4 and Inspire) but what really makes the Matrice interesting is the possibility to connect an onboard device using one of its UART port and talk with the autopilot.
